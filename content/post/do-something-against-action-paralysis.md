> "When you don't know what to do, do something."

My Geometry teacher used to say this before breaking down a troubling math problem on the board. I found it frustrating; do _what_? do it _how_? why bother, if I'm going to do it the wrong way and learn absolutely nothing---or worse, be laughed at for seeming to be a complete idiot?

 Back then I didn't have the awareness to identify **action paralysis**. At least not in an intentional way. Or rather, a solution-oriented way. My typical response to this phenomenon was to simply step away and play video games.

 Action paralysis is a common problem associated with people who over-think and over-analyze, always looking for the perfect solution. These kind of people (_my_ kind of people) create a kind of binary motivation engine within themselves:

  - If I can do it, I will
  - If I can't do it, I'll wait

And in the active moment:

  - If I understand, I'll participate
  - If I don't understand, I'll disengage

 This outlook continues to trouble me to this day---only now, as an adult, I've found more subtle ways of avoiding the responsibility (and risk) of tackling my personal goals and pushing through insecurity barriers.

### My goals sabotaged by action paralysis

- Write a blog
- Learn French (and Spanish, and Portuguese)
- Lift weights regularly
- Write a feature-length screenplay
- Author a web serial fiction series

### Escaping into the familiar isn't action

When we retreat into the familiar, it comes at the price of personal growth. The more obvious examples are simple distractions: social media, video games, hanging out with friends.

But what about productive distractions, like cleaning the house or working on your career? These things are great. You're doing a thing. **You're _doing_ a _thing_!!**

It isn't the right thing to be doing, though. If your goal is to write a blog and instead you clean the house or update your LinkedIn profile---you have failed. What's worse is that you have failed to even try.

Why? Sometimes I tell myself that I haven't prepared enough. I need to do my research. Take an online course. Watch more videos. Develop the idea more.

But it's a lie. I retreat to the comfort of denial.

### Get off the information treadmill

In the age of No Privacy and Big Data Analysis, we're often inundated with information (or misinformation). It's never been easier to find resources on _how to write a blog_ or _how to lift weights_. Just type your question into google, or reddit, or quora, and you're on your way.

**And then you fall into it**: the hypnotic chorus of conflicting subject matter experts, all branding and re-tooling their knowledge into particular techniques---proclaiming that theirs (and theirs alone) is the path to victory.

For the over-thinker, this is an unhealthy situation.

We don't want to go down the wrong path. The very idea feels worse than taking no path at all. Certainly it's better to wait for truth and fact to find its way to the surface.

Well, no. It isn't.

The cost of waiting is your time and the constant deprivation of experience. It's not worth waiting for the perfect answer. There isn't one. **Get comfortable with making mistakes and not knowing**.

- **Ask yourself**: why do you need to know anything to start?
  ```
  Answer: you don't
  ```

My personal growth has always come from the moments where I have chosen to throw myself into the unknown and take a risk. Every single important accomplishment or skill in my life can be traced to an impulsive, amorphous beginning.

I know this. It is important to stay aware of this---especially in those moments of action paralysis.

### This is my first blog post

The above statement isn't 100% true. I write professional tech industry blog posts for work all the time. The difference, however, is those blogs come with a lot of structure and research and _known_. It's work. I like work and I understand work.

This blog post is for myself. I **hate** doing things for myself. It's so much harder. And some of you probably feel the same way. Well: I've written this for you. Here is a record of someone else publicly admitting they do not know what they are doing (and choosing to do it anyway).

If you find my blog interesting, then I invite you to grow with me. I intend to share a lot of different thoughts, poems, growth post-mortems, fiction, and how-tos---not from the perspective of an expert, but from the perspective of someone who is _experiencing_.
