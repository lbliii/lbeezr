Let's talk about software releases --- and how almost no startup gets it right.

# What is a Release?

The problem starts here. To many developers, dev managers, product owners, and C-level stakeholders, a release means that the code for a given feature or product is complete and ready for production use. **This is simply  wrong.**

> Code readiness is not release readiness.

Think of the finished code as an airplane sitting on a tarmac. This is your shiny new product that you immediately want to ship and start making money with.

- Who is going to pilot? No one knows to fly it. (**Internal Training**)
- What do you train the future pilots with? (**Technical Documentation & Learning**)
- Who are your ideal buyers for this plane? why and how does it cater to their needs specifically? (**Marketing**)
- How are your agents going to sell this plane to commercial flight businesses? (**Sales Playbook**)
- Has it actually _ever_ been flown before? Stress tested in adverse conditions? What are its limitations? (**Quality Assurance**)
- How much should this plane sell for? Is there a basic and premium package? And what's it called, anyway? (**Product Marketing**)
- Who gets called if it breaks and how long is its warranty? What if the customer wants unique modifications --- are they possible? (**Support**)

When you go live with a new product or feature without giving supporting roles proper time to prepare for launch, you are hurting **everyone** involved. The customer becomes a guinea pig for a shoddy product. Support and implementation experts are forced to bare the brunt of customer frustrations at all hours of the day due to "fires" that must be put out. Marketing and Product Marketing experts have to scramble to align field teams on messaging, price points, and feature names...

... it goes on and on.

The cost of hastily pushing out a release on code alone is immense, and if your product can fail in ways that are catastrophic to your customer's lives or bottom-line, you won't make it to Series B funding --- let alone IPO.

A release is a product event made possible by the completion of a cross-departmental project, launched only when all contributors are ready.

# The Release Management Layer

Who decides to release if not the engineers? This puzzles many startups. Here's my answer: the release manager.

Having a dedicated release manager provides clear ownership of a release _without_ departmental bias. Performing the job requires embodying cross-departmental communication --- which in turn empowers teams to trust asynchronous sources of truth, as the release manager owns these pieces within the release management layer.  

The release management layer is a cross-departmental body where engineering, marketing, product marketing, support, and sales come together to check-in on the roadmap and signal baton-passing. This is similar to a "scrum of scrums" situation --- it is high level and does not dictate or micromanage the workload or workstyle of the various teams across the company.

When all relevant stakeholders report a green light to the release management layer, the release manager launches the product.

That's it. You've mastered software release management.
