Traveling to Europe is life changing. You're going to have a wonderful time strolling through the beautiful streets, eating bread and charcuterie, soaking in the local charm, making new friends, tasting every wine. But let's get you fully prepared first. You want to make the most of this trip by stepping off the plane ready to _go_.  

**This article covers everything I've learned about traveling around Europe** thus far and will cover anything new I discover in my future adventures.

I've been to Europe 2 times:

- once for a study abroad program at Swansea, Wales (6 months)
- once to Lisbon, Portugal (2 months)

During the 8 months I've spent in Europe, I've passed through England, Wales, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, Portual, and Spain---in that order. I've lived out of massive suitcases and backpacks.

With that said, let's start with luggage.

## Luggage Tips for Traveling to Europe

How long you plan to stay in Europe determines the amount of luggage you'll want to bring. There are a few things to consider regardless of whether you're a light or heavy packer:

- **You're limited to 1 carry-on and 1 personal item** when boarding a plane
- **Checked luggage can go from $30-100 per piece**, even if it's the same size as a carry-on
- **Checked luggage prices differ for each airline**; if you have booked flights individually to save money this is important to keep in mind

Remember, even if you're only in Europe for a week, you'll want to buy _something_ to bring back home. If you're like me that means clothes---and more than just a few pieces. Try to leave enough space in your luggage to bring back at least 1-2 new articles of clothing. Future you will thank me later.

### Minimalist Travel Luggage Strategy

Want to live out of your carry-on? You can do it. I have.

I'm an advocate of minimalist travel because it greatly reduces the already stressful experience of getting through airport security and hauling your belongings to/from your hotel or airbnb. I have severe airport anxiety; making travel simple is my highest priority.

What I discovered by embracing minimalist travel packing was that my life overall improved. I had less laundry to wash, fold, put away, or think about. Every piece I took with me brought me joy and was versatile.

#### How to Plan a Travel Capsule Wardrobe

A [capsule wardrobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_wardrobe) is a small collection of clothes that make up an entire seasonal series of outfits.

Sounds simple? It is. And it works like this: all pieces of the capsule wardrobe must complete at least 2-3 outfits. The goal here is to look sharp even if you randomly select what you're wearing for the day. It does not rely on hero pieces that cripple your look when inevitably ruined, stained, or still wet from the wash. (**Note**: Lots of apartments in Europe do not have a dryer; expect to hang those clothes.)

##### Example Travel Capsule Wardrobe

The bolded items are what you'll wear to the airport.

- 1 light wash pair of jeans
- **1 dark wash pair of jeans**
- 1 black pair of pants
- **1 white t-shirt**
- 1 black t-shirt
- 3 unique button shirts: 2 daytime and 1 club shirt
- **1 hoodie**
- 1 leather jacket
- **1 pair of walking shoes**
- 1 pair of club shoes
- 2 colognes
- **1 pair of sunglasses**
- Small accent accessories
- 3-4 pairs of boxers (**+1 you're wearing**)
- 3-4 pairs of socks (**+1 you're wearing**)

A lot of these items can be layered: t-shirt > Button shirt > hoodie > open leather jacket. Layering is common in European fashion and strongly encouraged. As you step between open hot sunny plazas and cool, shaded roads, you'll wish your look had some versatility.

**Build your own:**

1. Choose a color palette. Neutral is easy.  
2. Build everything around that palette.
3. Decide what pieces are going to be "loud" or have personality.
4. Make sure those statement pieces go with the majority of your looks.
5. Keep these rules in mind while shopping in Europe.

### How to fit clothes in carry-on luggage

If you're following the capsule wardrobe concept as a literal purist, you should have no problems fitting the above into a carry-on. But let's admit that's easier said than done. I brought 2 hoodies and 2 leather jackets + 3 pullover sweaters using this [American Tourister](https://amzn.to/2Qd7CyW). How'd I make it work?

#### The way you pack matters

##### 1. Socks, shoes, & underwear

1. Tuck your socks together as you would normally.
2. Stuff your socks into your shoes. Ideally, the shoes you pack are the least bulky pair you are bringing.
3. Fold your underwear horizontally (hamburger style).
2. Repeat until you have one narrow rectangle shape.
3. Stuff your underwear into your shoes if there is still room.
4. Set remaining underwear aside to pack in-between pants where there is room.
5. Place your filled shoes flat into the lower base (closest to you).

##### 2. Folding pants

1. Fold the pants in half vertically (hotdog style).
2. Fold them in half horizontally, bringing the leg openings to the waist.
3. Take the side opposite of the waist (the knees) and roll the pants tightly up to the waist. You should have a wide cylinder.
4. Repeat for all pants.
5. If you are packing shoes, pack those first flat at the base (closest to you) of the carry-on.
6. Place pants into the base of your carry-on, starting with the top (farthest from you). If it's a wheeled carry-on, it probably has handle columns that you can feel like a spine. I like to use those to squeeze about 2 pairs of pants above those bars.
7. Pack the rest of your underwear in any narrow crannies.

##### 3. Folding shirts

1. Fold the shirt in half horizontally (hamburger style).
2. Do it again.
3. Fold in the arms if they are short-sleeve; if long-sleeve, fold in but criss-cross them. Your shirt should now look like a long, narrow rectangle.
4. Repeat for all shirts.
5. Place your shirts in 2 separate and even stacks inside of your carry-on, on top of your rolled-up pants and shoes.

##### 4. Folding hoodies & jackets

Ideally, you'll try to wear both your jacket and hoodie as layers boarding the plane.

1. Fold the hoodie like you would the shirts.
2. Place it on top op the shirts
3. Half your jackets vertically once (hotdog style) and place over. Tuck the top and bottom into the carry-on.

**You've now finished packing your carry-on luggage.** Congrats! Now let's talk about onboard personal items.

### Personal items: the key to clever travel packing

When I went to Salamanca, Spain this past winter I decided to purchase a large, beautiful Moroccan leather backpack from an old street vendor. This was problematic because I already had a nice [wax canvas backpack](https://amzn.to/2YDs92I) with me on the trip. When it was time to return to the United States, however, I discovered that I'd bought so many new clothes that I actually needed both backpacks + my carry-on. So what did I do? I checked my carry-on so that I could bring both backpacks on board.

That's when something interesting happened at the airport that I never expected: **the flight attendants considered both of my backpacks personal items and asked me to move to an express queue to board the plane for people who had no carry-on luggage.** _Wait, what!?_

Yep. You read that correctly.

This not only worked for my flight into the United States, it also seemed to hold true for my flight to Chicago. There was no more overhead bin space and flight attendants were requiring passengers to tag and leave their carry-ons by the entrance of the plane. _They did not bother to tag either of my backpacks and simply let me take them onboard._

Some of you out there **hate** checking luggage at the gate. Maybe next time switch your carry-on to a backpack?

This tip may not work with all flights, so don't get crazy with it. But my experience leads me to believe that backpacks are given some grace in spite of their size (and having _two_ of them). When you're trying to pack light or squeeze everything in, **I strongly recommend backpacks**.  

## Fashion: How to look like a European

I don't think this is a super important topic because you should dress how you like to dress and feel comfortable. That being said, I understand wanting to blend in. The gist of it is **layers and nice, well-fitting clothes**.

Also, know at least these brands: Pull & Bear, H&M, Berskha, and Zara.

### Jackets

- **Black or tan leather jacket** (my black jacket was from target and only $50).
- **Tweed trenchcoats** (like a gray harringbone) look sharp and go with most outfits.

If you're in a pinch or don't want to use your precious limited luggage space for a heavy jacket, consider picking one up from somewhere like Zara. EU Zara is nicer than US Zara and you can find some amazing outer layer pieces.

{{<instagram BtYb0N9nqnt hidecaption>}}

### Tops

- **Basic tees** can be bought for cheap in the country you're visiting when luggage space is tight.
- **Pullovers** work from fall through spring as a versatile extra layer. This past season, Pull & Bear had a ton of nice options.

You will stand out a bit if you wear a lot of contemporary Hawaiian style short sleeve shirts that are popular in the United States. (I love them though soo again wear what you want.)

### Bottoms

- **Jeans** work literally everywhere. I brought AE jeans with me (this [light rinse pair](https://amzn.to/2QcEPdQ) and this [dark rinse pair](https://amzn.to/2VLRZVb)) and they did the job perfectly. However, while in Portugal I converted over to[ G-star Raw denim jeans](https://amzn.to/2HsgApf). It blew my mind how flexible and comfortable they were. Since then I've cut my AE jeans into shorts and fully embraced G-star as my denim of choice.
- **Black pants** are simple and classic. I relied on my pair for basically every night-time outfit.
- **Fitted oxfords** that look modern are very popular in Europe. Go for solid colors or very small patterns, like floral.

### Shoes

- **Tan Leather boots** are _fantastic_ for traveling. They age well, are indestructible, fashionable, and can be surprisingly comfy. If you invest in the right pair they should also last you a long, long time. I have this [pair from Oliberté](https://amzn.to/2EjqZBs) and they handled _everything_ I threw at them.
- **White sneakers** --- let's face it, they're a staple. You can get replacements basically anywhere for about $30 and you can clean them super easily with fingernail polish remover (Acetone).
- **Black boots** never look dirty. And the jeans + black boot look was practically invented by the UK 1960s punk fashion scene.

### Socks

- **Tube socks** are needed when you're wearing boots. In a jam I've worn my no-show socks with boots and it's _gross_. Don't do that.
- **No-show socks** look nice with white sneakers or other low-cut shoes. I recommend this brand of [merino wool socks](https://amzn.to/2LWrfwP). Yes, they're expensive but believe me when I say that they are **absolutely worth every penny**. Full disclosure: my feet tend to smell horrible. Like, so bad that it envelopes any room where I take my shoes off. It's been a point of concern for going on dates. I shower and wear fresh socks and for some reason regular socks are _really_ ineffective for me. I bought these socks out of desperation because I read that [merino wool is anti-microbial](http://www.outdoorsfather.com/2015/04/merino-wool-hype-basis/). These socks can be worn for days in a row without them smelling or feeling used --- I've put them through the test. They work fantastically well.

### Underwear

I believe new underwear is something you should give yourself periodically. Like a new toothbrush, it's just necessary. I used to buy really expensive underwear like Calvin Klein and even be subscribed to _NextGayThing_. But honestly? Not really worth it. Just pick up a fresh cheap pack from Target or Walmart and call it a day. Alternatively, I've also tried this pair of [marino wool boxers](https://amzn.to/2YIj88B) that are really nice for the same reason as the socks mentioned above. Take these with you when you're backpacking and have limited access to fresh clothes.

### Cologne

Remember that all liquids in your carry-on must fit in a quart-sized ziplock bag. Airports have the **3-1-1 rule**.

>3-1-1 for carry-ons = 3.4 ounce (100ml) bottle or less (by volume) ; 1 quart-sized, clear, plastic, zip-top bag; 1 bag per passenger placed in screening bin.

- You can buy some cheap tiny bottles of cologne in places like Zara in Europe for <$15.
- [L'EAU D'ISSEY by Issey Miyake](https://amzn.to/2YEd0hE) is my absolute favorite cologne and this bottle fits the oz limit.

## Electronics needed for Traveling to Europe

### EU Power Converter

Outlets are different in Europe. They're different in the UK, too. Some of your electronics may not work abroad even with a simple power adapter; in such cases you might need a full converter for things like an electric razor---I've broken one by only using a converter. Your phone and laptop _should_ have built in voltage adaptation.

- **EU outlets** are circular and take rounded, [two-prong plugs](https://amzn.to/2LVBiCe).
- **UK outlets** are [three-pronged](https://amzn.to/2Wc8YiH).
- There are [multi-purpose adapters](https://amzn.to/2VPB7wP) available too.

I bought the multi-purpose adapter first online on amazon. It works, but I'd like to caution you that they can be finnicky. Because of the way they're built, the multi-purpose adaptor sits really loosely in the EU socket. You can shock yourself if not careful. Frustrated by my loose adapter, I kept playing with it trying to get the light to turn on so I could charge my phone and I got shocked. **It hurt pretty bad.**

The UK and EU specific ones are cheaper, smaller, and fit snugly into the socket. I prefer those.

### Cameras

I'm not a photographer so I honestly cannot recommend any traditional camera for taking travel photos. Every photo that you see on my blog and instagram is taken with a [Pixel 2XL](https://amzn.to/2QasxCO). I do not believe the Pixel 3 is worth upgrading to, but this phone has been fantastic and I'm satisfied with the photo quality --- especially when using **portrait mode**.

Curious about **drone cameras**? I have the [DJI Spark](https://amzn.to/2VRPVuX) and it's very travel friendly. Each battery lasts about 15 minutes and the video quality is great. Flying it in public makes me nervous, so I've only taken it for a real spin once at the beach in Cascais. It's a little loud up close but no one paid it any attention while I flew it around. It's hand gestures are unique and convenient. I recommend it as a mid-grade starter drone. It's also already $100 less than what I paid back in December 2018. In case you're like me and wondering: no one in TSA gave me any trouble with this drone coming or going.

### EU & UK Phone SIM cards

I have Verizon and I get charged $10/day for international phone coverage. **This is insane and unacceptable.** Buy a SIM card when you travel to Europe, even if it's for just a week. You can get **one month of coverage for 10-20 euros**. Most of these SIM cards include chat packages which means FB Messenger and WhatsApp have higher data limits --- even for photo messages. The SIM card will have this written on it and include social media logos.

Don't worry if you do not have the special phone key to open your SIM card tray. Whoever sells you the SIM card will have a key and they can help you. Setting up your SIM card takes less than 5 minutes. It's seriously so easy.

The PIN that is on the SIM card is very important. Keep the card somewhere safe like in your wallet or hotel room; I kept mine within my phone case. You only get 3 tries to input the SIM card's PIN correctly upon any phone restart.

### Apps

- **Uber** is essential. Tired of walking? Drunk at 5am? Don't want to take the metro back to the airport? Just get an Uber. Note that some regions/countries may have more strict rules against Uber, so it won't always be available.
- **Local Uber** --- each country probably has their own version of Uber. I know Portugal does, and it can be cheaper to use. It's worth asking your new local friends or getting on a messsage board and seeing what's out there.
- **Local train apps** are super useful for booking day trips and staying on top of train schedules.
- **Google Translate** is not just a web service. It's also an app where you can download whole language libraries. Did you know that you can take a picture of a sign or menu and it will **convert the image's text into English**? It only takes a few seconds to render. Great for going to a restaurant alone or when you're just super confused.
- **Hopper** is my flight app of choice. It's not specific to Europe, but I book 90% of my flights on this app. I like the color-coded calendar that categorizes days by cost. This app tries to predict cost fluctuation and tells you if it's the right time to purchase or wait. I set travel alerts on hopper to get notified of when my trip is reasonably priced.

## Set up a bank travel notice

Your bank may freeze your debit and credit card if you suddenly pop up in Europe and start spending money. You can either call your bank to place the travel notice or do it through your banking app. For my bank, the notice is per card --- it may be different for you.

**Not every credit/debit card is going to be accepted abroad**. You are going to want to take out cash when you arrive in Europe. Exchange rates and charges vary. In my experience, certain ATMs don't seem to have updated exchange rates and this can become extremely wasteful. These tend to be the random alley ATMs. If you go to a bank instead, you'll likely get better exchange rates though the fees for the exchange will be different for each bank.

- Find out if your bank has "sister banks" operating in Europe; if they do, you can withdraw money from their ATMs for less fees.
- Take out larger sums of money to avoid more frequent fees.
- Consider using [TransferWise](https://transferwise.com/us). They claim to have the most competitive exchange rates and low fees. I've created an account for future use, but have not yet tested out the service. I'm eagerly awaiting their [borderless account debit card](https://transferwise.com/us/borderless/).

## Personal health items

Too shy to ask, "_where can I find lube and condoms_" at the local pharmacy? Make sure you go ahead and buy your favorites in optimistic quantities. I was too shy to ask in Mexico. They were hiding behind the counter. Lesson _learned_.

This goes for **contact lenses** and **prescriptions**, too. Your health --- physical and mental --- is important. Make sure you have enough to last for your entire trip.

## Travel Insurance

Some providers like Blue Cross and Blue Shield automatically provide a version of traveler's insurance for certain countries/regions. This usually presents as a suitcase icon on your insurance card. Check with your provider to confirm this availability and that it extends to where you are going.

Flights also can offer travelers insurance as an addon. It's worth considering for peace of mind, though I've had no personal experience utilizing coverage while abroad.

## Have your passport ready

It can take a while to get a passport, so please settle this as soon as possible. Submit your passport application 6-4 months before your trip. Passports must be valid for a minimum of 6 months upon entry into other countries, so don't let it get too close to expiring either.

I do not like keeping my passport on me while traveling. I hide my passport in my airbnb/hotel room and make sure I have several pictures of it both on my phone and backed up in the cloud, accessible by email. **You never know what could happen.** Locate a US Embassy in the event you lose your passport. They should be able to help you. [This article](https://travel.usnews.com/features/what-to-do-if-you-lose-your-passport-in-a-foreign-country) outlines what you'd need to obtain an emergency passport.

### Travel Visa (depending on where you're from)

Americans can stay up to 3 months at a time in the [Schengen Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area) without applying for a visa. Staying longer will require one. You can stay for a total of 6 months per year in the Schengen Area, given there are 90 days inbetween your first visit and second.

> Stay 3 Months > **Leave 3 Months** > Stay 3 months > **Leave 3 months**
