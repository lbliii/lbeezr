This blog is a collection of my thoughts on **remote work**, **traveling**, **video games**, and larger life topics. It might also become a home for new fiction pieces---should I manage to stop being lazy.

My greatest life influences, in no particular order: Alan Watts, Nina Simone, James Baldwin, Joseph Conrad, Florence Welch, Karen O, Audre Lorde, Bryan Fuller's _Pushing Daisies_, and lots of Japanese Anime.
