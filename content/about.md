This blog is a collection of my thoughts on **remote work**, **traveling**, **video games**, and larger life topics. It might also become a home for new fiction pieces---should I manage to stop being lazy.

My greatest life influences, in no particular order: Alan Watts, Nina Simone, James Baldwin, Joseph Conrad, Florence Welch, Karen O, Audre Lorde, Bryan Fuller's _Pushing Daisies_, and lots of Japanese Anime.  

## This is me:

## What do you do?

I am a nomad-ish technical writer working in the startup tech industry. More specifically, I work for a public cloud cost optimization platform that focuses on wrangling your AWS spend.

## Blog Disclaimer

Some of the links in my blog posts are affiliate links to:

- Amazon products that I either use while traveling or recommend
- Links to booking opportunities for destinations on-topic with the content

While this blog is a hobby, I hope to grow it into a larger project. I do not like obnoxious ads or banners and will never put them on this blog.
