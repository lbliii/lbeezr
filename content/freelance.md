I've been creating content for 3+ years in spaces like **FinTech** ([nCino][www.ncino.com]), **Health & EduTech** ([CastleBranch][www.castlebranch.com]), and **CloudOps** ([Metricly][www.metricly.com]). 

My goal is to help your business understand the importance and magnitude of accurate, on-message copy. In a world where software solutions are abundant, the user experience is often the most important differentiator. That includes not just design, but _all_ copy.

Things I'm good at:

- CMS research & migrations
- User & Setup Guides
- Technical documentation
- UX Copy
- Blog & Newsletter content
- Content Strategy (planning, brand voice & tone)
- Internal assets (product copy guides, content templates)
- On-page SEO optimization (Title, headers, descriptions, focus keywords)
