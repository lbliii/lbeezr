In a world where software solutions are abundant, the user experience is often the most important differentiator. When you think of the user experience, you might picture slick graphics and a beautiful UI --- but what about copy?

Written content often sorely neglected, cobbled together by disparate systems and inconsistent voices of engineers or PMs who have to throw it all together at the last minute. No one likes doing that. No one likes reading it, either.

My mission is to help businesses understand the impact of accurate, on-message content. That includes it's delivery methods, too.

 I've been creating content for 3+ years in spaces like **FinTech** ([nCino][1]), **Health & EduTech** ([CastleBranch][2]), and **CloudOps** ([Metricly][3]). I've written landing pages, an [AWS APN blog article][4], and owned entire [tech doc repositories][5] written in markdown.

Things I'm good at:

- CMS research & migrations
- User & Setup Guides
- Technical documentation
- UX Copy
- Blog & Newsletter content
- Content Strategy (planning, brand voice & tone)
- Internal assets (product copy guides, content templates)
- On-page SEO optimization (Title, headers, descriptions, focus keywords)
- Basic API documentation
- Product testing
- Content Analysis

Things I'm learning:

- Social media posts
- Advanced API documentation
- Marketing ads / copy testing
